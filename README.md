## 📝 Project Description
This project features an AI that learns to play [My Snake game](https://github.com/Thibault-GAREL/snake_game) autonomously using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. No hardcoded strategies — the agent improves over generations through genetic mutations and natural selection. 🧬🤖

---

## 🚀 Features
  🔄 No supervised learning – only evolution by fitness

  🧠 Networks evolve topologies and weights

  📊 Real-time simulation with visualization

  🏆 Tracks best fitness, average scores, and generation progress in Excel

---

## ⚙️ How it works

  🕹️ The AI controls a snake in my classic grid-based [Snake game](https://github.com/Thibault-GAREL/snake_game).

  🧬 It evolves over time using NEAT: networks mutate, reproduce, and get selected based on performance (fitness).

  👁️ Visual interface shows the best snake live as it learns.

  📈 An Excel is here to track the score or the loss.

## 🆚 Comparison — 4 Snake AI approaches

This project is part of a series of **4 Snake AI implementations** using different AI paradigms on the same game :

## 🗺️ Schema
⏳ Training takes time – early generations play poorly but evolve quickly. I train it approximately 15h and the best score is more than 20 apples. It can also **adapt** to different area. Here is the best neural network :

🧪 You can adjust mutation rates, population size, and other parameters in the NEAT config file.

3. **distance_bord_e** — Distance to the wall to the East
4. **distance_bord_s_e** — Distance to the wall to the South-East
5. **distance_bord_s** — Distance to the wall to the South
6. **distance_bord_s_w** — Distance to the wall to the South-West
7. **distance_bord_w** — Distance to the wall to the West
8. **distance_bord_n_w** — Distance to the wall to the North-West

#### Distance to food (8 inputs)

9. **distance_food_n —** Distance to the food to the North
10. **distance_food_n_e** — Distance to the food to the North-East
11. **distance_food_e** — Distance to the food to the East
12. **distance_food_s_e** — Distance to the food to the South-East
13. **distance_food_s** — Distance to the food to the South
14. **distance_food_s_w** — Distance to the food to the South-West
15. **distance_food_w** — Distance to the food to the West
16. **distance_food_n_w** — Distance to the food to the North-West

### For the output:
| # | Raw |
|---|-----|
| 0 | `UP` |
| 1 | `RIGHT` |
| 2 | `DOWN` |
| 3 | `LEFT` |
