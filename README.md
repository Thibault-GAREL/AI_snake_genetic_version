## 📝 Project Description 
This project features an AI that learns to play [My Snake game](https://github.com/Thibault-GAREL/snake_game) autonomously using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. No hardcoded strategies — the agent improves over generations through genetic mutations and natural selection. 🧬🤖

---

## 🚀 Features
  🔄 No supervised learning – only evolution by fitness

  🧠 Networks evolve topologies and weights

  📊 Real-time simulation with visualization

  🏆 Tracks best fitness, average scores, and generation progress in a Excel


## Example Outputs
Here is an image of what it looks like :

## ⚙️ How it works

  🕹️ The AI controls a snake in my classic grid-based [Snake game](https://github.com/Thibault-GAREL/snake_game).

  🧬 It evolves over time using NEAT: networks mutate, reproduce, and get selected based on performance (fitness).

  👁️ Visual interface shows the best snake live as it learns.

  📈 An Excel is here to track the score or the loss.

## 🗺️ Schema
⏳ Training takes time – early generations play poorly but evolve quickly. I train it approximately 15h and the best score is more than 20 apples. It can also **adapt** to different area. Here is the best neural network :

🧪 You can adjust mutation rates, population size, and other parameters in the NEAT config file.
